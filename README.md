Unfinished game; explode a square and it explodes others next to it. Mainly unfinished because I can't work out how to make the solver; that is, start with an empty board (the win condition) and make backwards moves until the board satisfies some criteria about density and easy-ness. Sort of conceptually inspired by Simon Tatham's puzzles, in that if this worked, it'd be the same sort of game as those (and I'd have probably dropped him a mail about it.)
